 /></span><i>PREFACE</i></h2>

<p><i>&lsquo;<span class="smc">A Cathedral Courtship</span>&rsquo; was first published
in 1893, appearing in a volume with &lsquo;Penelope&#8217;s
English Experiences.&rsquo; In course of time, the
latter story, finding unexpected favour in the
public eyes, left its modest companion, and was
promoted to a separate existence, with pictures
and covers of its own. Then something rather
curious occurred, one of those trifles which serve
to make a publisher&#8217;s life an exciting, if not a
happy, one. When the &lsquo;gentle reader&rsquo; (bless his
or her warm and irrational heart!) could no
longer buy &lsquo;A Cathedral Courtship,&rsquo; a new desire
for it sprang into being, and when the demands
became sufficiently ardent and numerous, it was
decided to republish the story, with illustrations
by Mr. Charles E. Brock, an artist who can be
<a name="png.008" id="png.008"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">viii</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>relied upon to put new energy into a live tale or
resuscitate a dead one.</i></p>

<p><i>At this point the author, having presumably
grown in knowledge of grammar, spelling, and
punctuation, was asked to revise the text, and
being confronted with the printed page, was overcome
by the temptation to add now and then a
sentence, line, or paragraph, while the charming
shade of Miss Kitty Schuyler perched on every
exclamation point, begging permission to say a
trifle, just a trifle, more.</i></p>

<p><i>&lsquo;You might allow me to explain myself just
there,&rsquo; she coaxed; &lsquo;and if you have told them
all I was supposed to be thinking in Winchester
or Salisbury or Oxford, why not tell them what
I thought in Bath or Peterborough or Ely? It
was awfully interesting!&rsquo;</i></p>

<p><i>Jack Copley, too, clamoured to be heard still
further on the subject of his true-love&#8217;s charms,
so the author yielded to this twofold pressure, and
added a few corroborative details.</i></p>

<p><i>The little courtship, running its placid course
through sleepy cathedral towns, has not been altered
in the least by these new pages. It is only as if
<a name="png.009" id="png.009"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span

 </span>the story-teller, meeting a new pair of interested
eyes, had almost unconsciously drifted into fresh
confidences.</i></p>

<p><span class="smc">We</span> are doing the English cathedral towns,
Aunt Celia and I. Aunt Celia has an
intense desire to improve my mind. Papa
told her, when we were leaving Cedarhurst,
that he wouldn&#8217;t for the world have
it too much improved, and Aunt Celia remarked
that, so far as she could judge,
there was no immediate danger; with
which exchange of hostilities they parted.</p>

<p>We are travelling under the yoke of an
<a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">2</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>iron itinerary, warranted neither to bend
nor break. It was made out by a young
High Church curate in New York, and if
it were a creed, or a document that had
been blessed by all the bishops and popes,
it could not be more sacred to Aunt Celia.
She is awfully High Church, and I believe
she thinks this tour of the cathedrals will
give me a taste for ritual and bring me
into the true fold. Mamma was a Unitarian,
and so when she was alive I
generally attended service at that church.
Aunt Celia says it is not a Church; that
the most you can say for it is that it is a
&lsquo;belief&rsquo; rather loosely and carelessly formulated.
She also says that dear old Dr.
Kyle is the most dangerous Unitarian she
knows, because he has leanings towards
Christianity.</p>

<p>Long ago, in her youth, Aunt Celia was
engaged to a young architect. He, with
his triangles and T-squares and things,
<a name="png.015" id="png.015"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">3</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>succeeded in making an imaginary scale-drawing
of her heart (up to that time a
virgin forest, an unmapped territory), which
enabled him to enter in and set up a
pedestal there, on which he has remained
ever since. He has been only a memory
for many years, to be sure, for he died at
the age of twenty-six, before he had had
time to build anything but a livery stable
and a country hotel. This is fortunate,
on the whole, because Aunt Celia thinks
he was destined to establish American
architecture on a higher plane, rid it of its
base, time-serving, imitative instincts, and
waft it to a height where, in the course
of centuries, it would have been revered
and followed by all the nations of the
earth.</p>

<p>I went to see the stable, after one of
these Miriam-like flights of prophecy on the
might-have-been. It isn&#8217;t fair to judge a
man&#8217;s promise by one modest performance,
<a name="png.016" id="png.016"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">4</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and so I shall say nothing, save that I am
sure it was the charm of the man that
won my aunt&#8217;s affection, not the genius of
the builder.</p>

<p>This sentiment about architecture and
this fondness for the very toppingest High
Church ritual cause Aunt Celia to look on
the English cathedrals with solemnity and
reverential awe. She has given me a
fat <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original lacks hyphen">note-book</ins>, with &lsquo;Katharine Schuyler&rsquo;
stamped in gold letters on the Russia-leather
cover, and a lock and key to
conceal its youthful inanities from the
general public. I am not at all the sort
of girl who makes notes, and I have told
her so; but she says that I must at least
record my passing impressions, if they are
ever so trivial and commonplace. She
also says that one&#8217;s language gains unconsciously
in dignity and sobriety by
being set down in black and white, and
that a liberal use of pen and ink will
<a name="png.017" id="png.017"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">5</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>be sure to chasten my extravagances of
style.</p>

<p>I wanted to go directly from Southampton
to London with the Abbotts, our
ship friends, who left us yesterday. Roderick
Abbott and I had had a charming
time on board ship (more charming than
Aunt Celia knows, because she was very
ill, and her natural powers of chaperoning
were severely impaired), and the prospect
of seeing London sights together was not
unpleasing; but Roderick Abbott is not in
Aunt Celia&#8217;s itinerary, which reads: &lsquo;Winchester,
Salisbury, Bath, Wells, Gloucester,
Oxford, London, Ely, Peterborough, Lincoln,
York, Durham.&rsquo; These are the
cathedrals Aunt Celia&#8217;s curate chose to
visit, and this is the order in which he
chose to visit them. Canterbury was too
far east for him, and Exeter was too far
west, but he suggests Ripon and Hereford
if strength and time permit.</p>

<p><a name="png.018" id="png.018"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">6</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Aunt Celia is one of those persons who
are born to command, and when they are
thrown in contact with those who are born
to be commanded all goes as merry as a
marriage bell; otherwise not.</p>

<p>So here we are at Winchester; and I
don&#8217;t mind all the Roderick Abbotts in the
universe, now that I have seen the Royal
Garden Inn, its pretty coffee-room opening
into the old-fashioned garden, with its
borders of clove-pinks, its aviaries, and
its blossoming horse-chestnuts, great towering
masses of pink bloom.</p>

<p>Aunt Celia has driven to St. Cross
Hospital with Mrs. Benedict, an estimable
lady tourist whom she &lsquo;picked up&rsquo; <i>en
route</i> from Southampton. I am tired, and
stayed at home. I cannot write letters,
because Aunt Celia has the guide-books,
so I sit by the window in indolent content,
watching the dear little school laddies,
with their short jackets and wide white
<a name="png.019" id="png.019"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">7</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>collars; they all look so jolly, and rosy,
and clean, and kissable. I should like to
kiss the chambermaid, too. She has a
pink print dress, no fringe, thank goodness
(it&#8217;s curious our servants can&#8217;t leave that
deformity to the upper classes), but shining
brown hair, plump figure, soft voice, and
a most engaging way of saying &lsquo;Yes,
miss? Anythink more, miss?&rsquo; I long to
ask her to sit down comfortably and be
English while I study her as a type, but
of course I mustn&#8217;t. Sometimes I wish
I could retire from the world for a season
and do what I like, &lsquo;surrounded by the
general comfort of being thought mad.&rsquo;</p>

<p>An elegant, irreproachable, high-minded
model of dignity and reserve has just
knocked and inquired what we will have
for dinner. It is very embarrassing to
give orders to a person who looks like a
Justice of the Supreme Court, but I said
languidly:</p>

<p><a name="png.020" id="png.020"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;What would you suggest?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How would you like a clear soup, a
good spring soup, to begin with, miss?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very much.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And a bit of turbot next, miss, with
anchovy sauce?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, turbot, by all means,&rsquo; I said, my
mouth watering at the word.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what else, miss? Would you
enjoy a young duckling, miss, with new
potatoes and green peas?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just the thing; and for dessert&mdash;&rsquo;
I couldn&#8217;t think what I ought to order
next in England, but the high-minded
model coughed apologetically, and, correcting
my language, said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was thinking you might like gooseberry-tart
and cream for a sweet, miss.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Oh that I could have vented my New
World enthusiasm in a sigh of delight as
I heard those intoxicating words, heretofore
met only in English novels!</p>

<p><a name="png.021" id="png.021"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">9</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Ye&mdash;es,&rsquo; I said hesitatingly, though I
was palpitating with joy, &lsquo;I fancy we
should like gooseberry-tart&rsquo; (here a bright
idea entered my mind); &lsquo;and perhaps, in
case my aunt doesn&#8217;t care for the gooseberry-tart,
you might bring a lemon-squash,
please.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now, I had never met a lemon-squash
personally, but I had often heard of it, and
wished to show my familiarity with British
culinary art.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It would &#8217;ardly be a substitute for
gooseberry-tart, miss; but shall I bring
<em>one</em> lemon-squash, miss?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, as to that, it doesn&#8217;t matter,&rsquo; I
said haughtily; &lsquo;bring a sufficient number
for two persons.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fivestar">* * * * *</p>

<p>Aunt Celia came home in the highest
feather. She had twice been mistaken for
an Englishwoman. She said she thought
<a name="png.022" id="png.022"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that lemon-squash was a drink; I thought,
of course, it was a pie; but we shall find
out at dinner, for, as I said, I ordered a
sufficient number for two persons, and the
head-waiter is not a personage who will
let Transatlantic ignorance remain uninstructed.</p>

<p>At four o&#8217;clock we attended evensong
at the cathedral. I shall not say what I
felt when the white-surpliced boy choir
entered, winding down those vaulted aisles,
or when I heard for the first time that
intoned service, with all its &lsquo;witchcraft of
harmonic sound.&rsquo; I sat quite by myself
in a high carved oak seat, and the hour
was passed in a trance of serene delight.
I do not have many opinions, it is true,
but papa says I am always strong on
sentiments; nevertheless, I shall not
attempt to tell even what I feel in these
new and beautiful experiences, for it has
been better told a thousand times.</p>

<p><a name="png.024" id="png.024"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>There were a great many people at
service, and a large number of Americans
among them, I should think, though we
saw no familiar faces. There was one
particularly nice young man, who looked
like a Bostonian. He sat opposite me.
He didn&#8217;t stare&mdash;he was too well bred,
but when I looked the other way he looked
at me. Of course, I could feel his eyes;
anybody can&mdash;at least, any girl can; but
I attended to every word of the service,
and was as good as an angel. When the
procession had filed out, and the last
strain of the great organ had rumbled into
silence, we went on a tour through the
cathedral, a heterogeneous band, headed
by a conscientious old verger, who did his
best to enlighten us, and succeeded in
virtually spoiling my pleasure.</p>

<p>After we had finished (think of &lsquo;finishing&rsquo;
a cathedral in an hour or two!), Aunt
Celia and I, with one or two others,
<a name="png.025" id="png.025"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>wandered through the beautiful close,
looking at the exterior from every possible
point, and coming at last to a certain
ruined arch which is very famous. It
did not strike me as being remarkable. I
could make any number of them with a
pattern without the least effort. But, at
any rate, when told by the verger to gaze
upon the beauties of this wonderful relic
and tremble, we were obliged to gaze also
upon the beauties of the aforesaid nice
young man, who was sketching it.</p>

<p>As we turned to go away, Aunt Celia
dropped her bag. It is one of those
detestable, all-absorbing, all-devouring,
thoroughly respectable, but never proud,
Boston bags, made of black cloth with
leather trimmings, &lsquo;C. Van T.&rsquo; embroidered
on the side, and the top drawn up with
stout cords which pass over the Boston
wrist or arm. As for me, I loathe them,
and would not for worlds be seen carrying
<a name="png.026" id="png.026"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">14</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>one, though I do slip a great many necessaries
into Aunt Celia&#8217;s.</p>

<p>I hastened to pick up the horrid thing,
for fear the nice young man would feel
obliged to do it for me; but, in my indecorous
haste, I caught hold of the wrong
end, and emptied the entire contents on
the stone flagging. Aunt Celia didn&#8217;t
notice; she had turned with the verger,
lest she should miss a single word of his
inspired testimony. So we scrambled up
the articles together, the nice young man
and I; and oh, I hope I may never look
upon his face <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original lacks people">again.</ins></p>

<p>There were prayer-books and guide-books,
a Bath bun, a bottle of soda-mint
tablets, a church calendar, a bit of gray
frizz that Aunt Celia pins into her cap
when she is travelling in damp weather, a
spectacle-case, a brandy-flask, and a bon-bon-box,
which broke and scattered cloves
and peppermint lozenges. (I hope he
<a name="png.027" id="png.027"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">15</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>guessed Aunt Celia is a dyspeptic, and not
intemperate!) All this was hopelessly
vulgar, but I wouldn&#8217;t have minded anything
if there had not been a Duchess
novel. Of course he thought that it belonged
to me. He couldn&#8217;t have known
Aunt Celia was carrying it for that accidental
Mrs. Benedict, with whom she went
to St. Cross Hospital.</p>

<p>After scooping the cloves out of the
cracks in the stone flagging&mdash;and, of
course, he needn&#8217;t have done this, unless
he had an abnormal sense of humour&mdash;he
handed me the tattered, disreputable-looking
copy of &lsquo;A Modern Circe,&rsquo; with
a bow that wouldn&#8217;t have disgraced a
Chesterfield, and then went back to his
easel, while I fled after Aunt Celia and
her verger.</p>

<p>As sure as my name is Jack Copley, I
saw the prettiest girl in the world to-day&mdash;an
American, too, or I am greatly mistaken.
It was in the cathedral, where I
have been sketching for several days. I
was sitting at the end of a bench, at afternoon
service, when two ladies entered by
the side-door. The ancient maiden, evidently
the head of the family, settled herself
devoutly, and the young one stole off
by herself to one of the old carved seats
back of the choir. She was worse than
pretty! I made a memorandum of her
during service, as she sat under the dark
carved-oak canopy, with this Latin inscription
over her head:</p>

<p class="i4"><a name="png.029" id="png.029"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">17</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><span class="smc">Carlton cum<br
 />Dolby<br
 />Letania<br
 />IX Solidorum<br
 />Super Flumina<br
 />Confitebor tibi<br
 />D&#363;c probati</span></p>

<p>There ought to be a law against a
woman&#8217;s making a picture of herself, unless
she is willing to allow an artist to &lsquo;fix
her&rsquo; properly in his gallery of types.</p>

<p>A black-and-white sketch doesn&#8217;t give
any definite idea of this charmer&#8217;s charms,
but sometime I&#8217;ll fill it in&mdash;hair, sweet
little hat, gown, and eyes, all in golden
brown, a cape of tawny sable slipping off
her arm, a knot of yellow primroses in
her girdle, carved-oak background, and
the afternoon sun coming through a
stained-glass window. Great Jove! She
had a most curious effect on me, that girl!
I can&#8217;t explain it&mdash;very curious, altogether
new, and rather pleasant. When one of
<a name="png.030" id="png.030"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">18</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the choir-boys sang &lsquo;Oh for the wings of
a dove!&rsquo; a tear rolled out of one of her
lovely eyes and down her smooth brown
cheek. I would have given a large portion
of my modest monthly income for the
felicity of wiping away that teardrop with
one of my new handkerchiefs, marked with
a tremendous &lsquo;C&rsquo; by my pretty sister.</p>

<p>An hour or two later they appeared
again&mdash;the dragon, who answers to the
name of &lsquo;Aunt Celia,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;nut-brown
mayde,&rsquo; who comes when she is called
&lsquo;Katharine.&rsquo; I was sketching a ruined
arch. The dragon dropped her unmistakably
Boston bag. I expected to see
encyclop√¶dias and Russian tracts fall from
it, but was disappointed. The &lsquo;nut-brown
mayde&rsquo; (who has been trained in the
way she should go) hastened to pick up
the bag for fear that I, a stranger,
should serve her by doing it. She was
punished by turning it inside out, and I
<a name="png.031" id="png.031"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">19</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was rewarded by helping her gather together
the articles, which were many and
ill-assorted. My little romance received
the first blow when I found that she reads
the Duchess novels. I think, however, she
has the grace to be ashamed of it, for she
blushed scarlet when I handed her &lsquo;A
Modern Circe.&rsquo; I could have told her that
such a blush on such a cheek would almost
atone for not being able to read at all, but
I refrained. It is vexatious all the same,
for, though one doesn&#8217;t expect to find perfection
here below, the &lsquo;nut-brown mayde,&rsquo;
externally considered, comes perilously
near it. After she had gone I discovered
a slip of paper which had blown under
some stones. It proved to be an itinerary.
I didn&#8217;t return it. I thought they must
know which way they were going; and as
this was precisely what I wanted to know,
I kept it for my own use. She is doing
the cathedral towns. I am doing the
<a name="png.032" id="png.032"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">20</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>cathedral towns. Happy thought! Why
shouldn&#8217;t we do them together&mdash;we and
Aunt Celia? A fellow whose mother and
sister are in America must have some
feminine society!</p>

<p>I had only ten minutes to catch my
train for Salisbury, but I concluded to run
in and glance at the registers of the principal
hotels. Found my &lsquo;nut-brown mayde&rsquo;
at once in the guest-book of the Royal
Garden Inn: &lsquo;Miss Celia Van Tyck,
Beverly, Mass., U.S.A. Miss Katharine
Schuyler, New York, U.S.A.&rsquo; I concluded
to stay over another train, ordered
dinner, and took an altogether indefensible
and inconsistent pleasure in writing &lsquo;John
Quincy Copley, Cambridge, Mass.,&rsquo; directly
beneath the charmer&#8217;s autograph.</p>

<p>We left Winchester on the 1.16 train
yesterday, and here we are within sight of
another superb and ancient pile of stone.
I wanted so much to stop at the Highflyer
Inn in Lark Lane, but Aunt Celia said
that if we were destitute of personal dignity,
we at least owed something to our
ancestors. Aunt Celia has a temperamental
distrust of joy as something dangerous
and ensnaring. She doesn&#8217;t realize
what fun it would be to date one&#8217;s letters
from the Highflyer Inn, Lark Lane, even
if one were obliged to consort with poachers
and trippers in order to do it.</p>

<p>Better times are coming, however, for
she was in a melting mood last evening,
and promised me that wherever I can find
an inn with a picturesque and unusual
<a name="png.034" id="png.034"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">22</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>name, she will stop there, provided it is
clean and respectable, if I on my part will
agree to make regular notes of travel in
my Russia-leather book. She says that
ever since she was my age she has asked
herself nightly the questions Pythagoras
was in the habit of using as a nightcap:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div>&lsquo;What have I learned that&#8217;s worth the knowing?</div>
<div>What have I done that&#8217;s worth the doing?</div>
<div>What have I sought I should have shunned,</div>
<div>And into what new follies run?&rsquo;</div>
</div>

<p>I asked her why Pythagoras didn&#8217;t say
&lsquo;runned&rsquo; and make a consistent rhyme,
and she evaded the point by answering
that Pythagoras didn&#8217;t write it in English.</p>

<p>We attended service at three. The
music was lovely, and there were beautiful
stained-glass windows by Burne-Jones
and Morris. The verger (when wound up
with a shilling) talked like an electric doll.
If that nice young man is making a
cathedral tour like ourselves, he isn&#8217;t
<a name="png.035" id="png.035"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">23</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>taking our route, for he isn&#8217;t here. If he
has come over for the purpose of sketching,
he wouldn&#8217;t stop with one cathedral,
unless he is very indolent and unambitious,
and he doesn&#8217;t look either of these.</p>

<p>Perhaps he began at the other end, and
worked down to Winchester. Yes, that
must be it, for the <cite>Ems</cite> sailed yesterday
from Southampton. Too bad, for he was
a distinct addition to the landscape. Why
didn&#8217;t I say, when he was picking up the
collection of curios in Aunt Celia&#8217;s bag,
&lsquo;You needn&#8217;t bother about the novel,
thank you; it is not mine, and anyway it
would be of no use to anybody.&rsquo;</p>

<p>We intended to go to Stonehenge this
morning, but it rained, so we took a
&lsquo;growler&rsquo; and went to the Earl of Pembroke&#8217;s
country place to see the pictures.
Had a delightful morning with the
<a name="png.036" id="png.036"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">24</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>magnificent antiques, curios, and portraits. The
Van Dyck room is a joy for ever; but one
really needs a guide or a friend who knows
something of art if one would understand
these things. There were other visitors;
nobody who looked especially interesting.
Don&#8217;t like Salisbury so well as Winchester.
Don&#8217;t know why. We shall drive this
afternoon, if it is fair, and go to Bath and
Wells to-morrow, I am glad to say. Must
read Baedeker on the Bishop&#8217;s palace.
Oh, dear! if one could only have a good
time and not try to know anything!</p>

others. Aunt Celia can tell them all apart.</i></p>

<p class="dateline"><small><span class="smc">Salisbury</span>,
 <span class="date"><i>June</i> 3,</span><br
 />The Red Lion.</small></p>

<p>I went off on a long tramp this afternoon,
and coming on a pretty river flowing
through green meadows, with a fringe of
trees on either side, I sat down to make a
sketch. I heard feminine voices in the
vicinity, but as these are generally a part
of the landscape in the tourist season, I
paid no special notice. Suddenly a dainty
patent-leather shoe floated towards me on
the surface of the stream. It evidently
had just dropped in, for it was right side
<a name="png.038" id="png.038"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">26</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>up with care, and was disporting itself
most merrily. &lsquo;Did ever Jove&#8217;s tree drop
such fruit?&rsquo; I quoted as I fished it out on
my stick; and just then I heard a distressed
voice saying, &lsquo;Oh, Aunt Celia,
I&#8217;ve lost my smart little London shoe. I
was sitting in a tree taking a pebble out of
the heel, when I saw a caterpillar, and I
dropped it into the river&mdash;the shoe, you
know, not the caterpillar.&rsquo;</p>

 alt="I offered it to her with distinguished grace"
 title="I offered it to her with distinguished grace" /></p>

<p>Hereupon she came in sight, and I witnessed
the somewhat unusual spectacle of
my &lsquo;nut-brown mayde&rsquo; hopping, like a
divine stork, on one foot, and ever and
anon emitting a feminine shriek as the
other, clad in a delicate silk stocking, came
in contact with the ground. I rose quickly,
and, polishing the patent leather ostentatiously
inside and out with my handkerchief,
I offered it to her with distinguished grace.
She sat hurriedly down on the ground with
as much dignity as possible, and then,
<a name="png.040" id="png.040"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>recognising me as the person who picked
up the contents of Aunt Celia&#8217;s bag, she
said, dimpling in the most distracting
manner (that&#8217;s another thing there ought
to be a law against): &lsquo;Thank you again;
you seem to be a sort of knight-errant.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Shall I&mdash;assist you?&rsquo; I asked. I might
have known that this was going too far.
Of course I didn&#8217;t suppose she would let
me help her put the shoe on, but I thought&mdash;upon
my soul, I don&#8217;t know what I
thought, for she was about a million times
prettier to-day than yesterday.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; she said, with polar
frigidity. &lsquo;Good-afternoon.&rsquo; And she
hopped back to her Aunt Celia without
another word.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how to approach Aunt
Celia. She is formidable. By a curious
accident of feature, for which she is not
in the least responsible, she always wears
an unfortunate expression as of one
<a name="png.041" id="png.041"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">29</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>perceiving some offensive odour in the immediate
vicinity. This may be a mere
accident of high birth. It is the kind of
nose often seen in the &lsquo;first families,&rsquo; and
her name betrays the fact that she is of
good old Knickerbocker origin. We go
to Wells to-morrow&mdash;at least, I think
we do.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t like Salisbury at first, but I
find it is the sort of place that grows on
one the longer one stays in it. I am quite
sorry we must leave so soon, but Aunt
Celia is always in haste to be gone. Bath
may be interesting, but it is entirely out of
the beaten path from here.</p>

 class="pgmark">30</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>afternoon here. We are always being
ridiculous, and he is always rescuing us.
Aunt Celia never really sees him, and
thus never recognises him when he appears
again, always as the flower of chivalry and
guardian of ladies in distress. I will never
again travel abroad without a man, even
if I have to hire one from a feeble-minded
asylum. We work like galley-slaves, Aunt
Celia and I, finding out about trains and
things. Neither of us can understand
Bradshaw, and I can&#8217;t even grapple with
the lesser intricacies of the A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C Railway
Guide. The trains, so far as I can see,
always arrive before they go out, and I
can never tell whether to read up the page
or down. It is certainly very queer that
the stupidest man that breathes, one that
barely escapes idiocy, can disentangle a
railway guide when the brightest woman
fails. Even the boots at the inn in Wells
took my book, and, rubbing his frightfully
<a name="png.043" id="png.043"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">31</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>dirty finger down the row of puzzling
figures, found the place in a minute, and
said, &lsquo;There ye are, miss.&rsquo; It is very
humiliating. I suppose there are Bradshaw
professorships in the English universities,
but the boots cannot have imbibed
his knowledge there. A traveller at
<i>table d&#8217;h√¥te</i> dinner yesterday said there are
three classes of Bradshaw trains in Great
Britain: those that depart and never arrive,
those that arrive but never depart, and
those that can be caught in transit, going
on, like the wheel of eternity, with neither
beginning nor end. All the time I have
left from the study of routes and hotels
I spend on guide-books. Now, I&#8217;m sure
that if any one of the men I know were
here, he could tell me all that is necessary
as we walk along the streets. I don&#8217;t say
it in a frivolous or sentimental spirit in the
least, but I do affirm that there is hardly
any juncture in life where one isn&#8217;t better
<a name="png.044" id="png.044"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">32</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>off for having a man about. I should
never dare divulge this to Aunt Celia, for
she doesn&#8217;t think men very nice. She
excludes them from conversation as if
they were indelicate subjects.</p>

<p>But to go on, we were standing at the
door of Ye Crowne and Keys at Wells,
waiting for the fly which we had ordered
to take us to the station, when who should
drive up in a four-wheeler but the flower
of chivalry. Aunt Celia was saying very
audibly, &lsquo;We shall certainly miss the train,
if the man doesn&#8217;t come at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pray take this cab,&rsquo; said the flower of
chivalry. &lsquo;I am not leaving for an hour
or more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Celia got in without a murmur; I
sneaked in after her, not daring to lift my
eyes. I don&#8217;t think she looked at him,
though she did vouchsafe the remark that
he seemed to be a civil sort of person.</p>

<p>I was walking about by myself this
<a name="png.045" id="png.045"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">33</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>afternoon. Aunt Celia and I had taken a
long drive, and she had dropped me in a
quaint old part of the town that I might
have a brisk walk home for exercise.
Suddenly it began to rain, which it is apt
to do in England, between the showers,
and at the same moment I espied a sign,
&lsquo;Martha Huggins, Licensed Victualler.&rsquo; It
was a nice, tidy little shop, with a fire on
the hearth and flowers in the window, and
I thought no one would catch me if I
stepped inside to chat with Martha until
the sun shone again. I fancied it would
be delightful and Dickensy to talk quietly
with a licensed victualler by the name of
Martha Huggins.</p>

<p>Just after I had settled myself, the flower
of chivalry came in and ordered ale. I
was disconcerted at being found in a
dramshop alone, for I thought, after the
bag episode, he might fancy us a family
of inebriates. But he didn&#8217;t evince the
<a name="png.046" id="png.046"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">34</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>slightest astonishment; he merely lifted
his hat, and walked out after he had
finished his ale. He certainly has the
loveliest manners, and his hair is a more
beautiful colour every time I see him.</p>

<p>And so it goes on, and we never get any
further. I like his politeness and his evident
feeling that I can&#8217;t be flirted and
talked with like a forward boarding-school
miss; but I must say I don&#8217;t think much
of his ingenuity. Of course one can&#8217;t have
all the virtues, but if I were he, I would
part with my distinguished air, my charming
ease&mdash;in fact, almost anything, if I
could have in exchange a few grains of
common-sense, just enough to guide me in
the practical affairs of life.</p>

 title="&ldquo;I was disconcerted at being found in a dramshop alone.&rdquo;" /></p>

<p>I wonder what he is? He might be an
artist, but he doesn&#8217;t seem quite like an
artist; or just a dilettante, but he doesn&#8217;t
look in the least like a dilettante. Or he
might be an architect; I think that is the
<a name="png.048" id="png.048"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">36</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>most probable guess of all. Perhaps he is
only &lsquo;going to be&rsquo; one of these things, for
he can&#8217;t be more than twenty-five or
twenty-six. Still, he looks as if he were
something already; that is, he has a kind
of self-reliance in his mien&mdash;not self-assertion,
nor self-esteem, but belief in self, as
if he were able, and knew that he was able,
to conquer circumstances.</p>

<p>Aunt Celia wouldn&#8217;t stay at Ye Olde
Bell and Horns here. She looked under
the bed (which, I insist, was an unfair test),
and ordered her luggage to be taken instantly
to the Grand Pump Room Hotel.</p>

<p>Memoranda: <i>Bath became distinguished
for its architecture and popular as a fashionable
resort in the 17th century from the
deserved repute of its waters and through
the genius of two men, Wood the architect
and Beau Nash, Master of Ceremonies.
A true picture of the society of the period
is found in Smollett&#8217;s &lsquo;Humphry Clinker&rsquo;,
<a name="png.049" id="png.049"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 </span>which Aunt Celia says she will read and
tell me what is necessary. Remember the
window of the seven lights in the Abbey
Church, the one with the angels ascending
and descending; also the rich Perp. chantry
of Prior Bird, S. of chancel. It is Murray
who calls it a Perp. chantry, not I.</i></p>


<h3><i>She</i></h3>

<p class="dateline"><small><span class="date"><i>June</i> 8.</span></small></p>

<p>It was very wet this morning, and I had
breakfast in my room. The maid&#8217;s name
is Hetty Precious, and I could eat almost
anything brought me by such a beautifully
named person. A little parcel postmarked
Bath was on my tray, but as the address
was printed, I have no clue to the sender.
It was a wee copy of Jane Austen&#8217;s &lsquo;Persuasion,&rsquo;
which I have read before, but
was glad to see again, because I had forgotten
that the scene is partly laid in Bath,
<a name="png.050" id="png.050"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">38</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and now I can follow dear Anne and vain
Sir Walter, hateful Elizabeth and scheming
Mrs. Clay through Camden Place and
Bath Street, Union Street, Milsom Street,
and the Pump Yard. I can even follow
them to the site of the White Hart Hotel,
where the adorable Captain Wentworth
wrote the letter to Anne. After more
than two hundred pages of suspense, with
what joy and relief did I read that letter!
I wonder if Anne herself was any more
excited than I?</p>

<p>At first I thought Roderick Abbott sent
the book, until I remembered that his
literary taste is <cite>Puck</cite> in America and <cite>Pick-me-up</cite>
and <cite>Tit-Bits</cite> in England; and now
I don&#8217;t know what to think. I turned to
Captain Wentworth&#8217;s letter in the last
chapter but one&mdash;oh, it <em>is</em> a beautiful
letter! I <em>wish</em> somebody would ever write
me that he is &lsquo;half agony, half hope,&rsquo; and
that I &lsquo;pierce his soul.&rsquo;  Of course, it
<a name="png.051" id="png.051"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">39</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>would be wicked to pierce a soul, and of
course they wouldn&#8217;t write that way nowadays;
but there is something perfectly
delightful about the expression.</p>

<p>Well, when I found the place, what do
you suppose? Some of the sentences in
the letter seem to be underlined ever so
faintly; so faintly, indeed, that I cannot
quite decide whether it&#8217;s my imagination
or a lead-pencil, but this is the way it
seems to look:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can listen no longer in silence. <u>I
must speak to you by such means as are
within my reach.</u> You pierce my soul. I
am half agony, half hope. Tell me not
that I am too late, that such precious feelings
are gone for ever. I offer myself to
you again with a heart even more your
own than when you almost broke it, eight
years and a half ago. Dare not say that
man forgets sooner than woman, that his
love has an earlier death. I have loved
<a name="png.052" id="png.052"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">40</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>none but you. Unjust I may have been,
weak and resentful I have been, but never
inconstant. <u>You alone have brought me
to Bath. For you alone, I think and
plan. Have you not seen this? Can you
fail to have understood my wishes? I had
not waited even these ten days, could I
have read your feelings, as I think you
must have penetrated mine.</u> I can hardly
write. I am every instant hearing something
which overpowers me. You sink
your voice, but I can distinguish the tones
of that voice when they would be lost on
others. Too good, too excellent creature!
You do us justice indeed. You do believe
that there is true attachment and constancy
among men. Believe it to be most fervent,
most undeviating, in</p>

<p class="rt">&lsquo;F. W.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="tb">Of course, this means nothing. Somebody
has been reading the book, and
<a name="png.053" id="png.053"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">41</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>marked it idly as he (or she) read. I can
imagine someone&#8217;s underlining a splendid
sentiment like &lsquo;Dare not say that man forgets
sooner than woman!&rsquo; but why should
a reader lay stress on such a simple sentence
as &lsquo;You alone brought me to Bath&rsquo;?</p>

<p>Nothing accomplished yet. Her aunt
is a Van Tyck, and a stiff one, too. I am
a Copley, and that delays matters. Much
depends upon the manner of approach.
A false move would be fatal. We have
seven more towns (as per itinerary), and if
their thirst for cathedrals isn&#8217;t slaked when
these are finished, we have the entire Continent
to do. If I could only succeed in
making an impression on the retina of
Aunt Celia&#8217;s eye! Though I have been
under her feet for ten days, she never yet
<a name="png.054" id="png.054"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">42</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>has observed me. This absent-mindedness
of hers serves me ill now, but it may
prove a blessing later on.</p>

<p>I made two modest moves on the chessboard
of Fate yesterday, but they were so
very modest and mysterious that I almost
fear they were never noticed.</p>

<p>Something else awfully exciting has
happened.</p>

<p>When we walked down the railway platform
at Bath, I saw a pink placard pasted
on the window of a first-class carriage. It
had &lsquo;<span class="allsc">VAN TYCK: RESERVED</span>,&rsquo; written on it,
after the English fashion, and we took our
places without question. Presently Aunt
Celia&#8217;s eyes and mine alighted at the same
moment on a bunch of yellow primroses
<a name="png.055" id="png.055"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">43</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>pinned on the stuffed back of the most
comfortable seat next the window.</p>

<p>&lsquo;They do things so well in England,&rsquo;
said Aunt Celia admiringly. &lsquo;The landlord
must have sent my name to the guard&mdash;you
see the advantage of stopping at the
best hotels, Katharine&mdash;but one would not
have suspected him capable of such a refined
attention as the bunch of flowers.
You must take a few of them, dear; you
are so fond of primroses.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Oh! I am having a delicious time
abroad! I do think England is the most
interesting country in the world; and as
for the cathedral towns, how can anyone
bear to live anywhere else?</p>


<h3><i>She</i></h3>

<p class="dateline"><small><span class="smc">Oxford</span>,
 <span class="date"><i>June</i> 12,</span><br
 />The Mitre.</small></p>

<p>It was here in Oxford that a grain of
common-sense entered the brain of the
<a name="png.056" id="png.056"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">44</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>flower of chivalry; you might call it the
dawn of reason. We had spent part of
the morning in High Street, &lsquo;the noblest
old street in England,&rsquo; as our dear Hawthorne
calls it. As Wordsworth had
written a sonnet about it, Aunt Celia was
armed for the fray&mdash;a volume of Wordsworth
in one hand, and one of Hawthorne
in the other. (I wish Baedeker and
Murray didn&#8217;t give such full information
about what one ought to read before one
can approach these places in a proper
spirit.) When we had done High Street,
we went to Magdalen College, and sat
down on a bench in Addison&#8217;s Walk,
where Aunt Celia proceeded to store my
mind with the principal facts of Addison&#8217;s
career, and his influence on the literature
of the something or other century. The
cramming process over, we wandered
along, and came upon &lsquo;him&rsquo; sketching a
shady corner of the walk.</p>

<p><a name="png.057" id="png.057"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">45</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Aunt Celia went up behind him, and,
Van Tyck though she is, she could not
restrain her admiration of his work. I
was surprised myself; I didn&#8217;t suppose so
good-looking a youth could do such good
work. I retired to a safe distance, and
they chatted together. He offered her
the sketch; she refused to take advantage
of his kindness. He said he would &lsquo;dash
off&rsquo; another that evening and bring it to
our hotel&mdash;&lsquo;so glad to do anything for a
fellow-countryman,&rsquo; etc. I peeped from
behind a tree and saw him give her his
card. It was an awful moment; I trembled,
but she read it with unmistakable approval,
and gave him her own with an expression
that meant, &lsquo;Yours is good, but beat that
if you can!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She called to me, and I appeared. Mr.
John Quincy Copley, Cambridge, was presented
to her niece, Miss Katharine
Schuyler, New York. It was over, and a
<a name="png.058" id="png.058"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">46</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>very small thing to take so long about,
too.</p>

<p>He is an architect, and, of course, has a
smooth path into Aunt Celia&#8217;s affections.
Theological students, ministers, missionaries,
heroes, and martyrs she may distrust,
but architects never!</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is an architect, my dear Katharine,
and he is a Copley,&rsquo; she told me afterwards.
&lsquo;I never knew a Copley who was not respectable,
and many of them have been more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After the introduction was over, Aunt
Celia asked him guilelessly if he had visited
any other of the English cathedrals. Any
others, indeed!&mdash;this to a youth who had
been all but in her lap for a fortnight. It
was a blow, but he rallied bravely, and,
with an amused look in my direction,
replied discreetly that he had visited most
of them at one time or another. I refused
to let him see that I had ever noticed him
before&mdash;that is, particularly.</p>

<p><a name="png.059" id="png.059"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">47</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>I wish I had had an opportunity of
talking to him of our plans, but just as I
was leading the conversation into the
proper channels, the waiter came in for
breakfast orders&mdash;as if it mattered what
one had for breakfast, or whether one had
any at all. I can understand an interest
in dinner or even in luncheon, but not in
breakfast; at least not when more important
things are under consideration.</p>

<p>I have done it, and if I hadn&#8217;t been a
fool and a coward I might have done it a
week ago, and spared myself a good deal
of delicious torment. &lsquo;How sweet must
be Love&#8217;s self possessed, when but Love&#8217;s
shadows are so rich in joy!&rsquo; or something
of that sort.</p>

<p>I have just given two hours to a sketch
of Addison&#8217;s Walk, and carried it to Aunt
Celia at the Mitre. Object, to find out
whether they make a long stay in London
(our next point), and, if so, where. It
seems they stop only a night. I said in
the course of conversation:</p>

<p>&lsquo;So Miss Schuyler is willing to forego a
London season? Marvellous self-denial!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My niece did not come to Europe for
a London season,&rsquo; replied Miss Van Tyck.
&lsquo;We go through London this time merely as
<a name="png.061" id="png.061"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">49</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>a cathedral town, simply because it chances
to be where it is geographically. We shall
visit St. Paul&#8217;s and Westminster Abbey,
and then go directly on, that our chain of
impressions may have absolute continuity
and be free from any disturbing elements.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Oh, but she is lovely, is Aunt Celia!
London a cathedral town!</p>

<p>Now, for my part, I should like to drop
St. Paul&#8217;s for once, and omit Westminster
Abbey for the moment, and sit on the top
of a bus with Miss Schuyler or in a hansom
jogging up and down Piccadilly. The
hansom should have bouquets of paper-flowers
in the windows, and the horse
should wear carnations in his headstall,
and Miss Schuyler should ask me questions,
to which I should always know the right
answers. This would be but a prelude,
for I should wish later to ask her questions
to which I should hope she would also
know the right answers.</p>

there is, and it is her voice.</p>

<p>I shall call there again to-morrow morning.
I don&#8217;t know on what pretext, but I
shall call, for my visit was curtailed this
evening by the entrance of the waiter, who
asked what they would have for breakfast.
Miss Van Tyck said she would be disengaged
in a moment, so naturally I
departed, with a longing to knock the
impudent waiter&#8217;s head against the uncomprehending
wall. Breakfast indeed!
A fellow can breakfast regularly, and yet
be in a starving condition.</p>

the most beautiful and original design to be

Remember also the retrochoir.
The lower tier of windows consists of three
long lancets, with groups of Purbeck shafts

diminishing from the centre, and set back,
as in the clerestory, within an arcade supported
by shafts.</i> (I don&#8217;t believe even he
could make head or tail of this.) <i>Remember
the curious bosses under the brackets

<p>This is one of the charmingest towns
we have visited, and I am so glad Aunt
Celia has a letter to the Canon in residence,
because it may keep her contented.</p>

<p>We walked up Steep Hill this morning
to see the Jews&#8217; house, but long before we
reached it I had seen Mr. Copley sitting
on a camp-stool, with his easel in front of
him. Wonderful to relate, Aunt Celia
recognised him, and was most cordial in
her greeting. As for me, I was never so
embarrassed in my life. I felt as if he
<a name="png.069" id="png.069"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 </span>knew that I had expected to see him in
London and Ely and Peterborough, though,
of course, he <em>couldn&#8217;t</em> know it, even if he
looked for, and missed, me in those three
dreary and over-estimated places. He
had made a most beautiful drawing of the
Jews&#8217; House, and completed his conquest
of Aunt Celia by presenting it to her. I
should like to know when my turn is
coming; but, anyway, she asked him to
luncheon, and he came, and we had such a
cosy, homelike meal together. He is even
nicer than he looks, which is saying a good
deal more than I should, even to a locked
book. Aunt Celia dozed a little after
luncheon, and Mr. Copley almost talked in
whispers, he was so afraid of disturbing
her nap. It is just in these trifling things
that one can tell a true man&mdash;courtesy to
elderly people and consideration for their
weaknesses. He has done something in
the world; I was sure that he had. He
<a name="png.070" id="png.070"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">58</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>has a little income of his own, but he is too
proud and ambitious to be an idler. He
looked so manly when he talked about it,
standing up straight and strong in his
knickerbockers. I like men in knickerbockers.
Aunt Celia doesn&#8217;t. She says
she doesn&#8217;t see how a well-brought-up
Copley can go about with his legs in that
condition. I would give worlds to know
how Aunt Celia ever unbent sufficiently to
get engaged. But, as I was saying, Mr.
Copley has accomplished something, young
as he is. He has built three picturesque
suburban churches suitable for weddings,
and a State lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>Aunt Celia says we shall have no worthy
architecture until every building is made
an exquisitely sincere representation of its
deepest purpose&mdash;a symbol, as it were, of
its indwelling meaning. I should think it
would be very difficult to design a lunatic
asylum on that basis, but I didn&#8217;t dare say
<a name="png.071" id="png.071"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">59</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>so, as the idea seemed to present no incongruities
to Mr. Copley. Their conversation
is absolutely sublimated when they
get to talking of architecture. I have just
copied two quotations from Emerson, and
am studying them every night for fifteen
minutes before I go to sleep. I&#8217;m going
to quote them some time offhand, just after
matins, when we are wandering about the
cathedral grounds. The first is this: &lsquo;The
Gothic cathedral is a blossoming in stone,
subdued by the insatiable demand of harmony
in man. The mountain of granite
blooms into an eternal flower, with the
lightness and delicate finish as well as the
aerial proportion and perspective of vegetable
beauty.&rsquo;  Then when he has recovered
from the shock of this, here is my
second: &lsquo;Nor can any lover of nature
enter the old piles of English cathedrals
without feeling that the forest overpowered
the mind of the builder, and that his chisel,
<a name="png.072" id="png.072"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">60</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>his saw and plane still reproduced its ferns,
its spikes of flowers, its locust, elm, pine,
and spruce.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Memoranda: <i>Lincoln choir is an example
of Early English or First Pointed, which
can generally be told from something else
by bold projecting buttresses and dog-tooth
moulding round the abacusses.</i> (The plural
is my own, and it does not look right.)
<i>Lincoln Castle was the scene of many prolonged
sieges, and was once taken by Oliver
Cromwell.</i></p>

<p>Kitty Schuyler is the concentrated essence
of feminine witchery. Intuition
strong, logic weak, and the two qualities
so balanced as to produce an indefinable
charm; will-power large, but docility equal,
<a name="png.073" id="png.073"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">61</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>if a man is clever enough to know how to
manage her; knowledge of facts absolutely
<i>nil</i>, but she is exquisitely intelligent in
spite of it. She has a way of evading,
escaping, eluding, and then gives you an
intoxicating hint of sudden and complete
surrender. She is divinely innocent, but
roguishness saves her from insipidity.
Her looks? She looks as you would imagine
a person might look who possessed
these graces; and she is worth looking at,
though every time I do it I have a rush
of love to the head. When you find a
girl who combines all the qualities you
have imagined in the ideal, and who has
added a dozen or two on her own account,
merely to distract you past all hope, why
stand up and try to resist her charm?
Down on your knees like a man, say I!</p>

<p class="fivestar">* * * * *</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting to adore Aunt Celia.  I
didn&#8217;t care for her at first, but she is so
<a name="png.074" id="png.074"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">62</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>deliciously blind. Anything more exquisitely
unserviceable as a chaperon I
can&#8217;t imagine. Absorbed in antiquity, she
ignores the babble of contemporaneous
lovers. That any man could look at Kitty
when he could look at a cathedral passes
her comprehension. I do not presume
too greatly on her absent-mindedness,
however, lest she should turn unexpectedly
and rend me. I always remember that
inscription on the backs of the little mechanical
French toys: &lsquo;Quoiqu&#8217;elle soit
tr√®s solidement mont√©e, il faut ne pas
brutaliser la machine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And so my courtship progresses under
Aunt Celia&#8217;s very nose. I say &lsquo;progresses&rsquo;;
but it is impossible to speak
with any certainty of courting, for the
essence of that gentle craft is hope, rooted
in labour and trained by love.</p>

<p>I set out to propose to her during service
this afternoon by writing my feelings
<a name="png.076" id="png.076"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">64</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>on the flyleaf of the hymn-book, or something
like that; but I knew that Aunt
Celia would never forgive such blasphemy,
and I thought that Kitty herself
might consider it wicked. Besides, if she
should chance to accept me, there was
nothing I could do in a cathedral to relieve
my feelings. No; if she ever accepts me,
I wish it to be in a large, vacant spot of
the universe, peopled by two only, and
those two so indistinguishably blended, as
it were, that they would appear as one to
the casual observer. So I practised repression,
though the wall of my reserve is
worn to the thinness of thread-paper, and
I tried to keep my mind on the droning
minor canon, and not to look at her, &lsquo;for
that way madness lies.&rsquo;</p>

<p>My taste is so bad! I just begin to
realize it, and I am feeling my &lsquo;growing
pains,&rsquo; like Gwendolen in &lsquo;Daniel Deronda.&rsquo;
I admired the stained glass in the Lincoln
Cathedral the other day, especially the
Nuremberg window. I thought Mr.
Copley looked pained, but he said nothing.
When I went to my room, I consulted a
book and found that all the glass in that
cathedral is very modern and very bad,
and the Nuremberg window is the worst
of all. Aunt Celia says she hopes that it
will be a warning to me to read before I
speak; but Mr. Copley says no, that the
world would lose more in one way than it
would gain in the other. I tried my
quotations this morning, and stuck fast in
the middle of the first.</p>

<p>Mr. Copley thinks I have been feeing
<a name="png.078" id="png.078"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">66</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the vergers too liberally, so I wrote a song
about it called &lsquo;The Ballad of the Vergers
and the Foolish Virgin,&rsquo; which I sang to
my guitar. Mr. Copley thinks it is cleverer
than anything he ever did with his pencil.
Of course, he says that only to be agreeable;
but really, whenever he talks to me
in that way, I can almost hear myself
purring with pleasure.</p>

<p>We go to two services a day in the
minster, and sometimes I sit quite alone in
the nave drinking in the music as it floats
out from behind the choir-screen. The
Litany and the Commandments are so
beautiful heard in this way, and I never
listen to the fresh, young voices chanting
&lsquo;Write all these Thy laws in our hearts,
we beseech Thee,&rsquo; without wanting passionately
to be good. I love, too, the
joyful burst of music in the <i>Te Deum</i>:
&lsquo;Thou didst open the kingdom of heaven
to all believers.&rsquo; I like that word &lsquo;all&rsquo;;
<a name="png.079" id="png.079"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">67</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>it takes in foolish me, as well as wise Aunt
Celia.</p>

<p>And yet, with all its pomp and magnificence,
the service does not help me quite
so much nor stir up the deep places, in me
so quickly as dear old Dr. Kyle&#8217;s simpler
prayers and talks in the village meeting-house
where I went as a child. Mr.
Copley has seen it often, and made a little
picture of it for me, with its white steeple
and the elm-tree branches hanging over it.
If I ever have a husband I should wish him
to have memories like my own. It would
be very romantic to marry an Italian
marquis or a Hungarian count, but must
it not be a comfort to two people to look
back on the same past?</p>

<p class="fivestar">* * * * *</p>

<p>We all went to an evening service last
night. It was an &lsquo;occasion,&rsquo; and a famous
organist played the Minster organ.</p>

<p>I wonder why choir-boys are so often
<a name="png.080" id="png.080"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">68</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>playful and fidgety and uncanonical in behaviour?
Does the choirmaster advertise
&lsquo;Naughty boys preferred,&rsquo; or do musical
voices commonly exist in unregenerate
bodies? With all the opportunities they
must have outside of the cathedral to exchange
those objects of beauty and utility
usually found in boys&#8217; pockets, there is
seldom a service where they do not barter
penknives, old coins, or tops, generally
during the Old Testament reading. A
dozen little black-surpliced &lsquo;probationers&rsquo;
sit together in a seat just beneath the choir-boys,
and one of them spent his time this
evening in trying to pull a loose tooth from
its socket. The task not only engaged all
his own powers, but made him the centre of
attraction for the whole probationary row.</p>

<p>Coming home, Aunt Celia walked ahead
with Mrs. Benedict, who keeps turning up
at the most unexpected moments. She&#8217;s
going to build a Gothicky memorial chapel
<a name="png.081" id="png.081"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">69</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>somewhere, and is making studies for it.
I don&#8217;t like her in the least, but four is
certainly a more comfortable number than
three. I scarcely ever have a moment
alone with Mr. Copley, for, go where I
will and do what I please, as Aunt Celia
has the most perfect confidence in my indiscretion,
she is always <i>en √©vidence</i>.</p>

<p>Just as we were turning into the quiet
little street where we are lodging, I said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh dear, I wish that I really knew
something about architecture!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you don&#8217;t know anything about it,
you are certainly responsible for a good
deal of it,&rsquo; said Mr. Copley.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I? How do you mean?&rsquo; I asked
quite innocently, because I couldn&#8217;t see
how he could twist such a remark as that
into anything like sentiment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have never built so many castles in
my life as since I&#8217;ve known you, Miss
Schuyler,&rsquo; he said.</p>

<p><a name="png.082" id="png.082"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">70</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; I answered as lightly as I could,
&lsquo;air-castles don&#8217;t count.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The building of air-castles is an innocent
amusement enough, I suppose,&rsquo; he
said; &lsquo;but I&#8217;m committing the folly of
living in mine. I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then I was frightened. When, all at
once, you find you have something precious
that you only dimly suspected was to
be yours, you almost wish it hadn&#8217;t come
so soon. But just at that moment Mrs.
Benedict called to us, and came tramping
back from the gate, and hooked her supercilious,
patronizing arm in Mr. Copley&#8217;s,
and asked him into the sitting-room to
talk over the &lsquo;lady-chapel&rsquo; in her new
memorial church. Then Aunt Celia told
me they would excuse me, as I had had a
wearisome day; and there was nothing for
me to do but to go to bed, like a snubbed
child, and wonder if I should ever know
the end of that sentence. And I listened
<a name="png.083" id="png.083"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">71</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>at the head of the stairs, shivering, but all
that I could hear was that Mrs. Benedict
asked Mr. Copley to be her own architect.
Her architect, indeed! That woman ought
not to be at large&mdash;so rich and good-looking
and unconscientious!</p>

<h3><i>He</i></h3>

<p class="dateline"><small><span class="smc">York</span>,
 <span class="date"><i>July</i> 5.</span></small></p>

<p>I had just established myself comfortably
near to Miss Van Tyck&#8217;s hotel, and found
a landlady after my own heart in Mrs.
Pickles, No. 6, Micklegate, when Miss
Van Tyck, aided and abetted, I fear, by
the romantic Miss Schuyler, elected to
change her quarters, and I, of course, had
to change too. Mine is at present a
laborious (but not unpleasant) life. The
causes of Miss Schuyler&#8217;s removal, as I
have been given to understand by the lady
herself, were some particularly pleasing
window-boxes in a lodging in High Petergate
<a name="png.084" id="png.084"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">72</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Street; boxes overflowing with pink
geraniums and white field-daisies. No one
(she explains) could have looked at this
house without desiring to live in it; and
when she discovered, during a somewhat
exhaustive study of the premises, that the
maid&#8217;s name was Susan Strangeways, and
that she was promised in marriage to a
brewer&#8217;s apprentice called Sowerbutt, she
went back to her conventional hotel and
persuaded her aunt to remove without
delay. If Miss Schuyler were offered a
room at the Punchbowl Inn in the Gillygate
and a suite at the Grand Royal Hotel
in Broad Street, she would choose the
former unhesitatingly; just as she refused
refreshment at the best caterer&#8217;s this afternoon
and dragged Mrs. Benedict and me
into &lsquo;The Little Snug,&rsquo; where an alluring
sign over the door announced &lsquo;A Homely
Cup of Tea for Twopence.&rsquo; But she would
outgrow all that; or, if she didn&#8217;t, I have
<a name="png.085" id="png.085"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">73</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>common-sense enough for two; or if I
hadn&#8217;t, I shouldn&#8217;t care a hang.</p>

<p>Is it not a curious dispensation of Providence
that, just when Aunt Celia is confined
to her room with a cold, Mrs. Benedict
should join our party and spend her
days in our company? She drove to the
Merchants&#8217; Hall and the Cavalry Barracks
with us, she walked on the city walls with
us, she even dared the &lsquo;homely&rsquo; tea at &lsquo;The
Little Snug&rsquo;; and at that moment I determined
I wouldn&#8217;t build her memorial church
for her, even at a most princely profit.</p>

<p>On crossing Lendal Bridge we saw the
river Ouse running placidly through the
town, and a lot of little green boats moored
at a landing-stage.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How delightful it would be to row for
an hour!&rsquo; exclaimed Miss Schuyler.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, do you think so, in those tippy
boats on a strange river?&rsquo; remonstrated
Mrs. Benedict.</p>

<p><a name="png.086" id="png.086"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">74</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The moment I suspected she was afraid
of the water, I lured her to the landing-stage
and engaged a boat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s a pity that that large flat one has a
leak, otherwise it would have held three
nicely; but I dare say we can be comfortable
in one of the little ones,&rsquo; I said doubtfully.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Shan&#8217;t we be too heavy for it?&rsquo; Mrs.
Benedict inquired timidly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&#8217;t think so. We&#8217;ll get in
and try it. If we find it sinks under our
weight we won&#8217;t risk it,&rsquo; I replied, spurred
on by such twinkles in Miss Schuyler&#8217;s
eyes as blinded me to everything else.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I really don&#8217;t think your aunt would
like you to venture, Miss Schuyler,&rsquo; said
the marplot.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, as to that, she knows I am accustomed
to boating,&rsquo; replied Miss Schuyler.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And Miss Schuyler is such an excellent
swimmer,&rsquo; I added.</p>

<p>Whereupon the marplot and killjoy
<a name="png.087" id="png.087"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">75</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>remarked that if it were a question of
swimming she should prefer to remain at
home, as she had large responsibilities
devolving upon her, and her life was in
a sense not her own to fling away as she
might like.</p>

<p>I assured her solemnly that she was
quite, quite right, and pushed off before
she could change her mind.</p>

<p>After a long interval of silence, Miss
Schuyler observed in the voice, accompanied
by the smile and the glance of the
eye, that &lsquo;did&rsquo; for me the moment I was
first exposed to them:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You oughtn&#8217;t to have said that about my
swimming, because I can&#8217;t a bit, you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was justified,&rsquo; I answered gloomily.
&lsquo;I have borne too much to-day, and if she
had come with us and had fallen overboard,
I might have been tempted to hold
her down with the oar.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon Miss Schuyler gave way to
<a name="png.088" id="png.088"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">76</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>such whole-hearted mirth that she nearly
upset the boat. I almost wish she had!
I want to swim, sink, die, or do any other
mortal thing for her.</p>

<p>We had a heavenly hour. It was only
an hour, but it was the first time I have
had any real chance to direct hot shot at
the walls of the maiden castle. I regret
to state that they stood remarkably firm.
Of course, I don&#8217;t wish to batter them
down; I want them to melt under the
warmth of my attack.</p>

<p>We had a lovely sail on the river Ouse
this afternoon. Mrs. Benedict was timid
about boating, and did not come with us.
As a usual thing, I hate a cowardly
woman, but her lack of courage is the
nicest trait in her whole character; I might
almost say the only nice trait.</p>

<p><a name="png.089" id="png.089"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">77</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Mr. Copley tried in every way, short of
asking me a direct question, to find out
whether I had received the marked copy
of &lsquo;Persuasion&rsquo; in Bath, but I evaded the
point.</p>

<p>Just as we were at the door of my
lodging, and he was saying good-bye, I
couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation of asking:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, before you knew us at all, did
you put &ldquo;Miss Van Tyck: Reserved,&rdquo; on
the window of the railway carriage at Bath?&rsquo;</p>

<p>He was embarrassed for a moment, and
then he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, she <em>is</em>, you know, if you come to
that; and, besides, I didn&#8217;t dare tell the
guard the placard I really wanted to put on.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shouldn&#8217;t think a lack of daring your
most obvious fault,&rsquo; I said cuttingly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not; but there are limits to
most things, and I hadn&#8217;t the pluck to
paste on a pink paper with &ldquo;Miss Schuyler:
Engaged,&rdquo; on it.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.090" id="png.090"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">78</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He disappeared suddenly just then, as if
he wasn&#8217;t equal to facing my displeasure,
and I am glad he did, for I was too
embarrassed for words.</p>

<h3><i>She</i></h3>

<p class="dateline"><small><span class="smc">Durham</span>,
 <span class="date"><i>July something or other</i>,</span><br
 />At Farmer Hendry&#8217;s.</small></p>

<p>We left York this morning, and arrived
in Durham about eleven o&#8217;clock. It seems
there is some sort of an election going on
in the town, and there was not a single fly
at the station. Mr. Copley looked about
in every direction, but neither horse nor
vehicle was to be had for love or money.
At last we started to walk to the village,
Mr. Copley so laden with our hand-luggage
that he resembled a pack mule.</p>

<p>We called first at the Three Tuns, where
<a name="png.091" id="png.091"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">79</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>they still keep up the old custom of giving
a wee glass of cherry-brandy to each guest
on his arrival; but, alas! they were
crowded, and we were turned from the
hospitable door. We then made a tour
of the inns, but not a single room was to
be had, not for that night, nor for two
days ahead, on account of that same
election.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hadn&#8217;t we better go on to Edinburgh,
Aunt Celia?&rsquo; I asked, as we were resting
in the door of the Jolly Sailor.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Edinburgh? Never!&rsquo; she replied.
&lsquo;Do you suppose that I would voluntarily
spend a Sunday in those bare Presbyterian
churches until the memory of these past
ideal weeks has faded a little from my
memory? What! leave out Durham and
spoil the set?&rsquo; (In her agitation and disappointment
she spoke of the cathedrals
as if they were souvenir spoons.) &lsquo;I intended
to stay here for a week or more,
<a name="png.092" id="png.092"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">80</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and write up a record of our entire trip
from Winchester while the impressions
were fresh in my mind.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And I had intended doing the same
thing,&rsquo; said Mr. Copley. &lsquo;That is, I
hoped to finish off my previous sketches,
which are in a frightful state of incompletion,
and spend a good deal of time on
the interior of this cathedral, which is unusually
beautiful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this juncture Aunt Celia disappeared
for a moment to ask the barmaid if, in her
opinion, the constant consumption of malt
liquors prevents a more dangerous indulgence
in brandy and whisky. She is
gathering statistics, but as the barmaids
can never collect their thoughts while they
are drawing ale, Aunt Celia proceeds
slowly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;For my part,&rsquo; said I, with mock humility,
&lsquo;I am a docile person, who never
has any intentions of her own, but who
<a name="png.093" id="png.093"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">81</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>yields herself sweetly to the intentions of
other people in her immediate vicinity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you?&rsquo; asked Mr. Copley, taking
out his pencil.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, I said so. What are you doing?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Merely taking note of your statement,
that&#8217;s all. Now, Miss Van Tyck&rsquo; (of
course Aunt Celia appeared at this delightful
moment), &lsquo;I have a plan to propose.
I was here last summer with a
couple of Harvard men, and we lodged at
a farmhouse about a mile distant from the
cathedral. If you will step into the coffee-room
for an hour, I&#8217;ll walk up to Farmer
Hendry&#8217;s and see if they will take us in.
I think we might be fairly comfortable.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can Aunt Celia have Apollinaris and
black coffee after her morning bath?&rsquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hope, Katharine,&rsquo; said Aunt Celia
majestically&mdash;&lsquo;I hope that I can accommodate
myself to circumstances. If
<a name="png.094" id="png.094"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">82</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Mr. Copley can secure apartments for us,
I shall be more than grateful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So here we are, all lodging together in
an ideal English farmhouse. There is a
thatched roof on one of the old buildings,
and the dairy-house is covered with ivy,
and Farmer Hendry&#8217;s wife makes a real
English curtsey, and there are herds of
beautiful sleek Durham cattle, and the
butter and cream and eggs and mutton are
delicious, and I never, never want to go
home any more. I want to live here for
ever and wave the American flag on
Washington&#8217;s birthday.</p>

<p>I am so happy that I feel as if something
were going to spoil it all. Twenty
years old to-day! I wish mamma were
alive to wish me many happy returns.</p>

<p>The cathedral is very beautiful in itself,
and its situation is beyond all words of
mine to describe. I greatly admired the
pulpit, which is supported by five pillars
<a name="png.095" id="png.095"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">83</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>sunk into the backs of squashed lions; but
Mr. Copley, when I asked him the period,
said, &lsquo;Pure Brummagem!&rsquo;</p>

<p>There is a nice old cell for refractory
monks, that we agreed will be a lovely
place for Mrs. Benedict if we can lose her
in it. She arrives as soon as they can
find room for her at the Three Tuns.</p>

<p>Memoranda:&mdash;Casual remark for breakfast-table
or perhaps for luncheon&mdash;it is a
trifle heavy for breakfast: <i>&lsquo;Since the sixteenth
century, and despite the work of
Inigo Jones and the great Wren</i> (not
Jenny Wren: Christopher), <i>architecture
has had, in England especially, no legitimate
development.&rsquo; This is the only
cathedral with a Bishop&#8217;s Throne or a
Sanctuary Knocker.</i></p>

<p>O child of fortune, thy name is J.&nbsp;Q.
Copley! How did it happen to be election
time? Why did the inns chance to
be full? How did Aunt Celia relax sufficiently
to allow me to find her a lodging?
Why did she fall in love with the lodging
when found? I do not know. I only
know Fate smiles; that Kitty and I eat
our morning bacon and eggs together;
that I carve Kitty&#8217;s cold beef and pour
Kitty&#8217;s sparkling ale at luncheon; that I
go to matins with Kitty, and dine with
Kitty, and walk in the gloaming with
Kitty&mdash;and Aunt Celia. And after a day
of heaven like this, like Lorna Doone&#8217;s
lover&mdash;ay, and like every other lover, I
suppose&mdash;I go to sleep, and the roof
above me swarms with angels, having
Kitty under it.</p>

<p><a name="png.097" id="png.097"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">85</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>She was so beautiful on Sunday. She
has been wearing her favourite browns and
primroses through the week, but on Sunday
she blossomed into blue and white, topped
by a wonderful hat, whose brim was laden
with hyacinths. She sat on the end of a
seat in the nave, and there was a capped
and gowned crowd of university students
in the transept. I watched them and they
watched her. She has the fullest, whitest
eyelids, and the loveliest lashes. When
she looks down I wish she might never
look up, and when she looks up I am
never ready for her to look down. If it
had been a secular occasion, and she had
dropped her handkerchief, seven-eighths
of the students would have started to pick
it up&mdash;but I should have got there first!
Well, all this is but a useless prelude,
for there are facts to be considered&mdash;delightful,
warm, breathing facts!</p>

<p>We were coming home from evensong,
<a name="png.098" id="png.098"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">86</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Kitty and I. (I am anticipating, for she
was still &lsquo;Miss Schuyler&rsquo; then, but never
mind.) We were walking through the
fields, while Mrs. Benedict and Aunt
Celia were driving. As we came across
a corner of the bit of meadow land that
joins the stable and the garden, we heard
a muffled roar, and as we looked around
we saw a creature with tossing horns and
waving tail making for us, head down,
eyes flashing. Kitty gave a shriek. We
chanced to be near a pair of low bars. I
hadn&#8217;t been a college athlete for nothing.
I swung Kitty over the bars, and jumped
after her. But she, not knowing in her
fright where she was nor what she was
doing, supposing also that the mad creature,
like the villain in the play, would &lsquo;still
pursue her,&rsquo; flung herself bodily into my
arms, crying, &lsquo;Jack! Jack! save me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was the first time she had called me
&lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; and I needed no second invitation.
<a name="png.099" id="png.099"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">87</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>I proceeded to save her, in the usual way,
by holding her to my heart and kissing
her lovely hair reassuringly as I murmured:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are safe, my darling; not a hair
of your precious head shall be hurt. Don&#8217;t
be frightened.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She shivered like a leaf.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am frightened,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I can&#8217;t
help being frightened. He will chase us,
I know. Where is he? What is he
doing now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Looking up to determine if I need abbreviate
this blissful moment, I saw the
enraged animal disappearing in the side-door
of the barn; and it was a nice, comfortable
Durham cow, that somewhat rare
but possible thing&mdash;a sportive cow.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is he gone?&rsquo; breathed Kitty from my
waistcoat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, he is gone&mdash;she is gone, darling.
But don&#8217;t move; it may come again.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.100" id="png.100"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">88</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>My first too hasty assurance had calmed
Kitty&#8217;s fears, and she raised her charming
flushed face from its retreat and prepared
to withdraw. I did not facilitate the preparations,
and a moment of awkward
silence ensued.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Might I inquire,&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;if the dear
little person at present reposing in my
arms will stay there (with intervals for
rest and refreshment) for the rest of her
natural life?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She withdrew entirely now, all but
her hand, and her eyes sought the
ground.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose I shall have to&mdash;that is,
if you think&mdash;at least, I suppose you do
think&mdash;at any rate, you look as if you
were thinking&mdash;that this has been giving
you encouragement.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do indeed&mdash;decisive, undoubted, bare-faced
encouragement.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t think I ought to be judged as
<a name="png.101" id="png.101"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">89</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>if I were in my sober senses,&rsquo; she replied.
&lsquo;I was frightened within an inch of my
life. I told you this morning that I was
dreadfully afraid of bulls, especially mad
ones, and I told you that my nurse frightened
me, when I was a child, with awful
stories about them, and that I never outgrew
my childish terror. I looked everywhere
about. The barn was too far, the
fence too high; I saw him coming, and
there was nothing but you and the open
country. Of course, I took you. It was
very natural, I&#8217;m sure; any girl would
have done it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; I replied soothingly, &lsquo;any
girl would have run after me, as you
say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I didn&#8217;t say any girl would have run
after you&mdash;you needn&#8217;t flatter yourself;
and besides, I think I was really trying to
protect you as well as to gain protection,
else why should I have cast myself on you
<a name="png.102" id="png.102"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">90</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>like a catamount, or a catacomb, or whatever
the thing is?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, darling, I thank you for saving
my life, and I am willing to devote the remainder
of it to your service as a pledge
of my gratitude; but if you should take
up life-saving as a profession, dear, don&#8217;t
throw yourself on a fellow with&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Jack! Jack!&rsquo; she cried, putting her
hand over my lips, and getting it well
kissed in consequence. &lsquo;If you will only
forget that, and never, never taunt me
with it afterwards, I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll&mdash;well, I&#8217;ll do
anything in reason&mdash;yes, even marry
you!&rsquo;</p>

<h3><i>He</i></h3>

<p class="dateline"><small><span class="smc">Canterbury</span>,
 <span class="date"><i>July</i> 31,</span><br
 />The Royal Fountain.</small></p>

<p>I was never sure enough of Kitty, at
first, to dare risk telling her about that
<a name="png.103" id="png.103"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">91</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>little mistake of hers. She is such an
elusive person that I spend all my time in
wooing her, and can never lay the flattering
unction to my soul that she is really
won.</p>

<p>But after Aunt Celia had looked up my
family record and given a provisional consent,
and Papa Schuyler had cabled a reluctant
blessing, I did not feel capable of
any further self-restraint.</p>

<p>It was twilight here in Canterbury, and
we were sitting on the vine-shaded veranda
of Aunt Celia&#8217;s lodging. Kitty&#8217;s head was
on my shoulder. There is something very
queer about that; when Kitty&#8217;s head is on
my shoulder, I am not capable of any consecutive
train of thought. When she puts
it there I see stars, then myriads of stars,
then, oh! I can&#8217;t begin to enumerate the
steps by which ecstasy mounts to delirium;
but, at all events, any operation
which demands exclusive use of the intellect
<a name="png.104" id="png.104"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">92</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>is beyond me at these times. Still,
I gathered my stray wits together, and
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Kitty!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, Jack?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now that nothing but death or marriage
can separate us, I have something to confess
to you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said serenely, &lsquo;I know
what you are going to say. He was a
cow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I lifted her head from my shoulder
sternly, and gazed into her childlike, candid
eyes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You mountain of deceit! How long
have you known about it?&rsquo;</p>

 title="&ldquo;Lor&#8217;, miss!&rdquo; said Farmer Hendry, &ldquo;he haven&#8217;t
been pastured there for three weeks&rdquo;" /></p>

<p>&lsquo;Ever since the first. Oh, Jack, stop
looking at me in that way! Not the very
first, not when I&mdash;not when you&mdash;not
when we&mdash;no, not then, but the next
morning, I said to Farmer Hendry, &ldquo;I
wish you would keep your savage bull
<a name="png.106" id="png.106"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">94</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>chained up while we are here; Aunt Celia
is awfully afraid of them, especially those
that go mad, like yours!&rdquo; &ldquo;Lor&#8217;, miss!&rdquo;
said Farmer Hendry, &ldquo;he haven&#8217;t been
pastured here for three weeks. I keep him
six mile away. There ben&#8217;t nothing but
gentle cows in the home medder.&rdquo; But I
didn&#8217;t think that you knew, you secretive
person! I dare say you planned the whole
thing in advance, in order to take advantage
of my fright!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never! I am incapable of such an
unnecessary subterfuge! Besides, Kitty,
I could not have made an accomplice of
a cow, you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; she said, with great dignity, &lsquo;if
you had been a gentleman and a man of
honour, you would have cried, &ldquo;Unhand
me, girl! You are clinging to me under
a misunderstanding!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Jack and I are going over this same
ground next summer on our wedding
journey. We shall sail for home next
week, and we haven&#8217;t half done justice to
the cathedrals. After the first two, we
saw nothing but each other on a general
background of architecture. I hope my
mind is improved, but oh, I am so hazy
about all the facts I have read since I
knew Jack! Winchester and Salisbury
stand out superbly in my memory. They
acquired their ground before it was occupied
with other matters. I shall never
forget, for instance, that Winchester has
the longest spire and Salisbury the highest
nave of all the English cathedrals. And
I shall never forget so long as I live that
Jane Austen and Isaac Newt&mdash; Oh
<a name="png.108" id="png.108"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 </span>dear! was it Isaac Newton or Izaak
Walton that was buried in Winchester
and Salisbury? To think that that interesting
fact should have slipped from my
mind, after all the trouble I took with it!
But I know that it was Isaac somebody,
and that he was buried in&mdash;well, he was
buried in one of those two places. I am
not certain which, but I can ask Jack; he
is sure to know.</p>

By <span class="smc">Alexander Black</span>. Profusely illustrated with designs and
photographs by the Author. Royal 8vo., elegantly bound in silk cloth,
with charming cameo portrait on side, 10s. 6d. net.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Particularly fresh and original in idea is &ldquo;Modern Daughters.&rdquo; Mr. Black
has written some exceedingly clever conversations, which give us verbal pictures,
so to speak, of some characteristic types of American womanhood. The chapters
called &ldquo;With a Gym Girl&rdquo; and &ldquo;With a Club Woman&rdquo; are specially successful.
There is a perception and a sense of humour about them which make
them not only delightful to read, but worth thinking about afterwards. The
illustrations, which are excellent, consist mainly of portraits which would be
recognised at once by anyone familiar with the American Society of to-day&mdash;a
fact which should make the book interesting to American women in London.
The volume is well and prettily bound, and its &ldquo;get-up&rdquo; is admirable. It is

excellent illustrative work done by Mr. Cole.&rsquo;&mdash;<cite>King</cite>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nearly every feature of this little book is tasteful and appropriate. Praise
is due to the typography, paper, and binding, and, above all, to Mr. Cole&#8217;s

groom, and the &ldquo;merry minstrelsy&rdquo; entering the hall.&rsquo;&mdash;<cite>Athen√¶um</cite>.</p>
